# Infoscheme
This project aims to provide an interactive platform for viewing the government schemes that have been uploaded by administrators from the State Governments and the Central Government.

We provide two independent portals:
1 - Admin Portal : This portal will be accesible to only selected Government Officials who will upload the schemes along with all details and constraints.
                   We provide customisable constraints which are scalable for any scheme.
                   
2 - User Portal : This portal provides static and dynamic filters
                  Static : Basic filters like age, category and income, etc.
                  Dynamic  : Automatically generated queries for the user, based on the schemes present to filter search results and show the relevant schemes to the user.
